### Full Stack Web Developer Student at Trybe
Here you can find my activities as a student and as a freelancer in web development.

I am passionate about Technology and my goal is to learn and apply all the acquired knowledge.

I study Full Stack Web Development at Trybe, a school that in its teaching methodology gives its students a real day by day experience as a web developer, has a curriculum with more than **1500 hours** of online classes in addition content and projects for offline study and covers front-end, back-end, computer science, software engineering, agile methodologies and soft skills.

I believe in actions that can have a positive impact on people's lives.
I also really like the area of digital media and video production, I already had a company in this area, for some years.
